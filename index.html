        <h3>Professional Style</h3>
        <p>Building on my previous roles as a Technical Writer/Editor in aerospace and as an Irregular Warfare Analyst in the defense industry, I've had the pleasure of developing government deliverables and products requiring intensive analysis, editing, and formatting under firm deadlines. They often involved collaborating with subject matter experts or other analysts to create multiple, complex products for a single project. Today, as a Software Engineer, I combine project and time management with strong communication skills to help my team succeed and deliver quality products to our customers. Former colleagues have told me they appreciate my systematic approach to problem-solving, my positive attitude, my ability to communicate effectively under stressful circumstances, my tenacity, and my ability to organize work.</p>
